Probabilistically determine word association
- strengths
- relationships
- frequencies
- other edge qualia dimensions

Encourage sparse activations to make the primitive combinations interpretable.
	• Semantic Coherence: Penalize unlikely primitive combinations based on a predefined coherence matrix or learned during training.
	• Rationale: Soft constraints guide the model toward interpretability without hindering performance.
