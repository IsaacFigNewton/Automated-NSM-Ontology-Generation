Represent words as subgraphs of nodes that have been “activated” within the ontology

Decide which words act as edge vector dimensions, which act as concept embedding space dimensions
- [Vertex Descriptors](Ontology-Vertex-Representation)
- [Edge Descriptors](Ontology-Edge-Representation.md)

Represent conditional logical operations with ambiguous solutions as follows:
- Activation or deactivation of input nodes, semi-activation of ambiguous nodes
- Activate resultant node/s based on likelihood of input outcome

Ultimate embedding should be a vector with <65 dimensions representing a location in the concept space
- <65 dimensions because some of the 65 semantic primes are augmentors (edge/transformation vector dimensions)
