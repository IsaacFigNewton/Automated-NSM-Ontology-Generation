Ambiguity: High

Queries, Keys, and Values:
- Compute queries, keys, and values based on primitive embeddings.
- Maintain the standard computation for the primitive-based input.

Attention Weights:
- The attention scores reflect the similarity of primitives between tokens.
- Optionally, design attention heads to focus on specific primitive groups (e.g., one head for “actions,” another for “objects”).
