- Represent Learned association edges as qualifier vectors
	- 1 dimension for each form of qualia
	- Examples:
		- degree of membership/ownership to another node’s concept
		- degree of desire for other node’s concept
		- similitude
		- etc.
- Don’t use positional encoding for intensifiers or similarity encoding, instead multiplying or otherwise increasing similitude dimension of all edge associations
