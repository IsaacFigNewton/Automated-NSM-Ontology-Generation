Ambiguity: Extremely high
Relevance: Extremely high

- Represent Learned association edges as qualifier vectors
	- 1 dimension for each form of qualia
	- Examples:
		- degree of membership/ownership to another node’s concept
		- degree of desire for other node’s concept
		- similitude
		- etc.
- Edges as augmentors in different encoding methods
	- Instead apply edge vectors as transformation measures:
		- [Use group theory to determine suitable transformations/operations](Group-Theory-Approach)
	- [Positional Encoding](Positional-Encoding)
