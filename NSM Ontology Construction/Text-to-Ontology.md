Parsing down to core concepts:
1. Break text into parse tree variations
2. Decompose compound words into prefixes, suffixes, roots
3. Embed the word roots into the ontology
4. Reconstruct text meaning from the recombination of the text structure

Build an ontology with the following properties:
- Vector-weighted edges
- Only value-holding nodes are semantic primitive nodes
- All non-primitive concept nodes are defined by their edge relations to primitive and other non-primitive nodes
