- Represent token transition probabilities instead as conceptual space transition probabilities by estimating transition gradient in concept/semantic embedding space
- Represent token embedding transition probabilities as a gradient estimation problem where the gradient at a given point aka embedding represents the probability of transitioning from one embedding in the concept space to another
