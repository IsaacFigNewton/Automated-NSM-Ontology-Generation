Description: Adapt the output layer to generate predictions based on primitive representations.

Prediction Layer:
- Use a linear layer to map the final primitive-based representations to the desired output space (e.g., vocabulary size for language modeling).
Vocabulary Mapping:
- Reverse the primitive-to-token mapping process used in the embedding layer to decode outputs using something like KNN.
