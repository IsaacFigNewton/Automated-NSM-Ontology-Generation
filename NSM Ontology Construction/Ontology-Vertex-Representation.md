#Ambiguity/Low
#Relevance/Very_high

Non-primitive vertices should have no attributes other than maybe labels
Only select semantic primitives should have vector representations
Each primitive's vertex represents an orthonormal concept space basis vector

## Primitives to use as basis
#### Life and death:
- live
- die = do + not live
#### Time:
- Can maybe represent all using augmentors (quantity, hirearchy for before/after) applied to "moment"?
- when / time
- now
- before
- after
- a long time
- a short time
- for some time
- moment
#### Space:
- Can maybe represent all using augmentors (quantity, hirearchy for before/after) 
- where / place
- here
- above
- below
- far
- near
- side
- inside
- touch (contact)
- **size**
#### Actions, events:
- do
- happen
- move
#### Speech:
- say
- words
#### Substantives:
- I
- you
- someone
- people
- something/thing
- body
#### Evaluators:
- Maybe represent with just "not" applied to "good"
- good
- bad
#### Logical Concepts:
- not/don't/won't
- **true** (moved from speech category)
